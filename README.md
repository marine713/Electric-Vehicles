This repo contains a dataset that shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).
A Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is an all-electric vehicle using one or more batteries to store the electrical energy that powers the motor and is charged by plugging the vehicle in to an electric power source. A Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) is a vehicle that uses one or more batteries to power an electric motor; uses another fuel, such as gasoline or diesel, to power an internal combustion engine or other propulsion source; and is charged by plugging the vehicle in to an electric power source. Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility is based on the fuel requirement and electric-only range requirement.
The main aim of this project is to come up with an accurate model that is able to determine the CAFV Eligibilty of a vehicle when given certain data
